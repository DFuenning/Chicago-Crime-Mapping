# Chicago-Crime-Mapping
Project #2, building a website to track Chicago's crime history


## This app was created to track and map out all major crimes in the Chicago area. 
## Also, this allows users to submit reports based on crime they witnessed that may have gone unreported in order to created a larger database of crime.

## This was created using MySQL, Express, Handlebars, Node, JawsDB, CSS, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript.
